 POP_Census.110.t: "Burden of Taxation"
 POP_Census.110.d: "The complex task of extracting resources from the realm is one with great cost for our central government. High taxation levels cost disproportionately more Administrative, Diplomatic and Military Power to uphold, while simple economics of scale in a larger realm can leave our efforts more scattered and constrained.\n\nThe values listed within the options below have been extracted in a yearly lump sum from our saved pool to support provincial taxation. Generally, an allocation of around 10~15 Power for each category is considered 'average' taxation, with levels above or below this amount exchanging more or less Power for varying levels of resources. Revenue generated from each tax type can be seen in the Bureaucracy estate, or through cycling a given province's Provincial Administration modifier. Additionally, this event can be hidden away in the decision menu."

These expectations however are often not codified, or written in stone. Loyalty is what binds the [Prov_Noble_P], loyalty to their overlord, their family and potentially the realm.\n\nTo support the [Prov_Noble_P] is to reinforce the hierarchy, to empower landlords and uphold the social order. Prestige and legitimacy are essential currency when at court with a [Prov_Noble], as is the personal bond that must be forged to achieve true collaboration with the rural elite."
 Prov_UI.041.t: "Support the Burghers"
 Prov_UI.041.d: "The leaders of urbanised settlements across the realm are often diverse in power and standing, yet it is the Burghers that elevate a settlement in wealth and influence. They are the oligarchs of towns and cities, the moneylenders and dominant traders who forge international connections that can stretch entire continents.\n\nTo win the favor of the Burghers, supporting their efforts of commerce and industry is essential. Yet it is autonomy that a Burgher truly desires, freedom from obligations that more often than not tie the Burghers to a rigid and unprofitable ancien order."
 Prov_UI.042.t: "Support the Clergy"
 Prov_UI.042.d: "The spiritual realm can only be guided by a select few, those who understand the divine connections that bind humanity to a power greater than themselves. To further their interests is to expand the domain of the spiritual to the greatest extent of the temporal world, to enshrine the importance of Spirituality and the divine.\n\nSupporting the Clergy is a matter of faith, yet also more often than not an issue of resources and finance. With greater tithes and further protections, the Clergy can support their missions in the temporal realm and expand the extent of their influence."
 Prov_UI.043.t: "Support the Clans"
 Prov_UI.043.d: "A clan is fundamentally tied to an idea of a greater kin, a community of which one bond is shared that supersedes all others. The strength of this bond however can be shaken, twisted by the stratified hierarchy and societal obligations that call a people away from kinship, away from an idea of Clans.\n\nTo support the leaders of the Clans is to reinforce and uphold the bonds of kin that tie society together, rejecting those who would call for new ties of loyalty and obligation. Empowering the chiefs directly can accomplish much to this end, as can a greater effort to remind the people of the bonds they share."
 Prov_UI.044.t: "Direct the Bureaucrats"
 Prov_UI.044.d: "Every realm needs a guiding hand, and there is no greater calling than an idea of state, of government and administration. Officials become administrators, servants become loyalists and the administrative apparatus becomes an entity within itself, a bureaucracy of and for the state.\n\nTo build a state, the power and reach of the Bureaucracy must be expanded, encompassing all lands and all peoples as its domain. Building state reach will do much to ensure a powerful bureaucracy, as will supporting efforts to keep them loyal and effective. A corrupt bureaucracy is a tool of the elites, a fact that must always be remembered."
 Prov_UI.045.t: "Reach out to the Commoners"
 Prov_UI.045.d: "The realm is more than the Elites, even as powerful and wealthy as they can be. Farmers, miners, craftsmen and artisans, the people of the realm are as diverse and essential as any Elite, their support essential for the fortunes of any dynasty. If the people are not content, those in power will surely know this in time.\n\nAt the most basic level, the people must have food and shelter, security in their needs to avoid a turn to banditry and revolt. It is when a commoner becomes educated, wealthy and secure in themselves that they begin to aspire for greater things, for a quality of life often well beyond their own..."
 Prov_UI.060.t: "Leverage the [Prov_Noble_P]"
 Prov_UI.060.d: "The [Prov_Noble_P] are the ancient bedrock of the realm, upholding the social order through a loose yet valuable set of obligations and services for the realm. These expectations however are often not codified, or written in stone. Loyalty is what binds the [Prov_Noble_P], loyalty to their overlord, their family and potentially the realm.\n\nThough the [Prov_Noble_P] can become all powerful, they are not as eternal as they claim. Through concerted efforts that target their rank, prestige and influence, the reach of the [Prov_Noble_P] can be suppressed, and their interests forcefully aligned with the realm."
 Prov_UI.061.t: "Leverage the Burghers"
 Prov_UI.061.d: "The leaders of urbanised settlements across the realm are often diverse in power and standing, yet it is the Burghers that elevate a settlement in wealth and influence. They are the oligarchs of towns and cities, the moneylenders and dominant traders who forge international connections that can stretch entire continents.\n\nWhile the Burghers can create great wealth for their communities, this wealth can become a corruption for the realm that leaves towns and cities as islands onto themselves. Efforts to supress autonomy and target less supportive industries can ensure the Burghers align themselves with the needs of the realm."
 Prov_UI.062.t: "Leverage the Clergy"
 Prov_UI.062.d: "The spiritual realm can only be guided by a select few, those who understand the divine connections that bind humanity to a power greater than themselves. To further their interests is to expand the domain of the spiritual to the greatest extent of the temporal world, to enshrine the importance of Spirituality and the divine.\n\nEven the most benign of interests can be subject to human nature, exemplified best by the corruption that can befall the Clergy. A friendly reminder of their original purpose and a concerted effort to reign in excessive overreach of the divine can ensure the ongoing longevity of the realm."
 Prov_UI.063.t: "Leverage the Clans"
 Prov_UI.063.d: "A clan is fundamentally tied to an idea of a greater kin, a community of which one bond is shared that supersedes all others. The strength of this bond however can be shaken, twisted by the stratified hierarchy and societal obligations that call a people away from kinship, away from an idea of Clans.\n\nThe bonds of kin are powerful, a fact we can use to leverage the Chiefs for our interests. Tribute, support and manpower can be leveraged from those who are loyal, while new societal obligations and responsibilities can convert the unconvinced towards our supreme interest."
 Prov_UI.046.t: "Anti-Corruption Measures"
 Prov_UI.046.d: "Cleansing the realm of corruption is an arduous endeavour, a task that requires constant vigilance and an incorruptible will. Upending the interests of an entrenched bureaucracy will invite pain upon the realm, yet such a task is necessary to ensure the state does not fall prey to its own stagnation. While the right campaign can be effective, without addressing the root causes of corruption we are doomed to see our realm fester wtih time."

 Prov_UI.050.t: "[Prov_Noble] Land Grants"
 Prov_UI.050.d: "Land is the lifeblood of the [Prov_Noble_P], providing them with a revenue stream that forms the heart of their power. Granting the [Prov_Noble_P] with State-owned land will go far to endear them to the state."
 Prov_UI.051.t: "Burgher Property Grants"
 Prov_UI.051.d: "Production is a powerful revenue stream for the burghers, who derive their wealth from commerce and facilities under their control. Expanding their control over urban property will allow them to form vertical monopolies they can leverage as a new powerbase."
 Prov_UI.052.t: "Church Land Grants"
 Prov_UI.052.d: "The church derives its wealth from donations and property, using both for their own, charitable work. Land grants can ensure the church's political independence and long-standing power."
 Prov_UI.055.t: "Commoner Land and Property Grants"
 Prov_UI.055.d: "Providing commoners with control over the property they themselves work is a path to a new powerbase, the people themselves. Freeholding and small business will flourish if the people can control their own future."
 Prov_UI.056.t: "Grain Distribution"
 Prov_UI.056.d: "In times of war, famine or great upheaval, food can become an expense too far for the masses. The state can become the guarantor of the people when necessary, endearing the government with the people at great expense."
