 flavor_bav.201.t:1 "From the sixth to eighth century, the Duchy of Bavaria was a frontier region in the southeastern part of the Merovingian kingdom and was ruled by dukes under Frankish lordship. In the late ninth century a new duchy was created from this area. It was one of the stem duchies of the Kingdom of Germany and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nBetween 1070 and 1180 the Emperor was opposed by Bavaria, especially by the House of Welf. In the final conflict between Duke Henry the Lion and the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick I, Frederick triumphed and deprived Henry of his fiefs. Bavaria then passed over to the House of Wittelsbach. Since there was no preference for succession of the firstborn in the Wittelsbach dynasty, Bavaria was subdivided between different branches of the Wittelsbach dynasty into separate duchies, often at odds with one another.\n\nWe believe ourselves to be the sole legitimate claimant to the united Duchy of Bavaria. No longer shall we abide with mediocrity."

In \"Dialogues with savage Adario\", he attempts to contrast the injustice of Christianity with the freedom and justice of the native people. His idealized view of \"natural humanity\" as a vehicle for criticising European civilisation has led to the expression \"noble savage\"."

 flavor_nap.6.d:1 "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo was the first viceroy of Naples to effectively govern the kingdom on behalf of the Spanish crown. While issuing grand construction projects and modernising the country, part of the reason for his success was his firm rule and ruthlessness. Where previous viceroys had failed to exert control over the kingdom, \"Don Pedro\" closed down humanist institutions and instituted harsh penalties for petty crimes. He centralised national institutions, and moved every court to the Castel Capuano. By breaking up traditional land holdings, barons were forced to move to the city where they would be within reach of de Toledo's government.\n\nHe failed in introducing the Spanish Inquisition in Naples, however, as revolts forced the Spanish king to retract the order. De Toledo passed away shortly after, in 1552, while on state business in Siena, ensuring that his legacy of state building would forever outshine the harshness of his rule."

The old walls were expanded and new ones were built along the seafront. Fortresses, shipyards and barracks were modernised and expanded. He also commissioned a new palace for the Viceroy, which was then surrounded by buildings in square-grid streets. The Spanish Quarter, as it was called, was the first of its kind in Europe, and is still one of the most distinct areas of Naples. The express goal was to make Naples invulnerable, but it also had the side effect of making it the second largest city in Europe at the time. By his death in 1552, the legacy of the harsh ruler as a city-builder was more than secure, and Naples would continue to be a centre of southern European power for centuries."

In October 1660, these events led the estates - the nobility only reluctantly - to create a hereditary monarchy. The new system meant that the king was no longer dependant on the Rigsråd, and he immediately used his new power to introduce absolutism, which was temporarily established on 10 January 1661 in the Hereditary Monarchy Act before being fully set out in Kongeloven (the King's Law) of 1665, the basic law of Danish absolutism."

Then he subjugated Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St. Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708).
