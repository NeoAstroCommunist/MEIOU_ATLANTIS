 flavor_A20.1.d: "Our state is at the intersection of the Islamic and Christian worlds, trying to keep the balance, but with the coming to power of Joseph, who spent most of his youth in Qartba Jdida and converted to Islam, the scales clearly swung towards the crescent."

 flavor_TWR.1.t: "Beliefs of the White Devils"
 flavor_TWR.1.d: "Near our borders there is a state of aliens from the north. Our fishermen often unload fish at the local port and talk about rich decorations and strange beliefs. Many of them are gradually integrating the customs of foreigners into their daily lives. Maybe the leader should take a look at the city of foreigners himself?"
 flavor_TWR.1.a: "Send someone who knows their language to ask to give the chief a tour of the city."
 flavor_TWR.1.b: "We are not interested in their barbaric customs."
 flavor_TWR.2.t: "Guests from the jungle"
 flavor_TWR.2.d: "Tattooed barbarians from the south beat all the thresholds, asking for a meeting with 'their chief'. The guards let one in and he told them that their leader wanted to take a look at the wonderful city and wanted to be given a tour. Should we let them in?"

 flavor_TWR.2.b: "Let these savages into our civilization? No"
 flavor_TWR.3.t: "A great journey"
 flavor_TWR.3.d: "A huge gate opened before the leader. A city made of stone, decorated with colored fabrics and lanterns. Life was bustling everywhere, shops were packed with goods. We were shown the relics of their people, made of stunning green stone with art that we could not even imagine. After a whole day full of impressions, when the leader's delegation was about to sail back to our boring village, explosions of different colors shone in the sky above the city.

 flavor_TWR.5.t: "Journey to the capital of white people"
 flavor_TWR.5.d: "Stories about traveling to a city on the border still excite minds. Our people are completely absorbed in the culture of foreigners and a trip to the capital of this amazing people is on the agenda. Perhaps we should start openly cooperating with the people of Penglai?"
 flavor_TWR.5.a: "If we want to achieve the same well-being, we have one choice."
 flavor_TWR.5.b: "They have their own traditions, we have our own. Don't go that far."
 flavor_TWR.6.t: "The second delegation from the South"
 flavor_TWR.6.d: "The ambassadors, already better dressed than last time, again ask for an audience. They expressed a desire to deepen our relations and start a full-fledged exchange between our peoples. Of course, they can't give us anything, but it will be useful to have an ally, albeit a small one, in an unfamiliar land."
 flavor_TWR.6.a: "We agree, but we don't decide. Send a message to Penglay."
 flavor_TWR.6.b: "We have been given an order not to let anyone through. Even you."
 flavor_TWR.7.t: "A letter from the Eastern Protectorate"
 flavor_TWR.7.d: "The Great Protector of the East informs in a letter that some savages wish to meet with the emperor himself in order to establish relations between our "tribes".

 flavor_TWR.10.a: "and bows"
 flavor_TWR.11.t: "Writing"
 flavor_TWR.11.d: "Due to the fact that our people do not have their own written language, we began to use the written language of the Penglai people. Gradually, our people are becoming like their people, adopting their faith, their writing, and even borrowing a lot from their language. Is it possible that we should switch to their language completely in order to be closer to civilization?"
 flavor_TWR.11.a: "Nihao"
 flavor_TWR.11.b: "We are Maori, not Penglai"
 flavor_ZLP.1.t: "Treasure Island Sale"
 flavor_ZLP.1.d: "Treasure island, damn it. Some fool blurted out that there are treasures on it - and that's it, a gold rush. We've been digging for years, and we haven't found anything! What if there is no treasure there?! THE LOOT HAS ALREADY BEEN SPENT! We are in debt! And damn Penglay has strengthened the protection of convoys and now we are broke. A little more and we will run out of money altogether. Maybe we should sell this damn island and get at least a little from it? Buddhists are interested in putting their paws on it."
 flavor_ZLP.1.a: "Goodbye, Treasure Island"
 flavor_ZLP.1.b: "WHAT IF THERE ARE TREASURES THERE AFTER ALL?!"
 flavor_ZLP.2.t: "Boat from the island"
 flavor_ZLP.2.d: "A bunch of pirates from a nearby island sailed to us with an offer to purchase the island for a small amount. Strange, before that they had been digging land on it for years, and then abruptly decided to sell it? It looks suspicious, but we need the island."
 flavor_ZLP.2.a: "Let's take a chance"
 flavor_ZLP.2.b: "We have no dealings with pirates"
 flavor_ZLP.3.t: "A successful business"
 flavor_ZLP.3.d: "Ah-ha-ha, that's it! At least some penny from this piece of land. And I told them that it should be dumped, not dug. There are no treasures there!"
 flavor_ZLP.3.a: "Who is the smartest? I am!"
 flavor_ZLP.4.t: "There will be no deal"
 flavor_ZLP.4.d: "Fools in robes don't want to deal with us because we are pirates. Oh-oh."
 flavor_ZLP.4.a: "Back to the shovel"
 flavor_ZLP.5.t: "Treasures found"
 flavor_ZLP.5.d: "Not happening... THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY HERE! There are so many of them here! Yes, this is enough for several thousand lives! Well, or a couple of hundred."
 flavor_ZLP.5.a: "So it wasn't a myth..."
 flavor_ZLP.5.b: "Wow, the pirates were right"
 flavor_ZLP.6.t: "So where are they?"
 flavor_ZLP.6.d: "We haven't heard anything from the team we sent to dig for a long time. I have a bad feeling about this."
 flavor_ZLP.6.a: "Send someone reliable to the island"
 flavor_ZLP.6.b: "I can guess where to look for them"
 flavor_ZLP.7.t: "And here they are"
 flavor_ZLP.7.d: "These scoundrels were found. I thought they were trying to steal from me. Where is the gold?"
 flavor_ZLP.7.a: "Wow... so much money..."
 flavor_ZLP.8.t: "Easy money"
 flavor_ZLP.8.d: "The secret police caught a bunch of idiots in a pub who were showing off a suspiciously large amount of money everywhere. They were initially suspected of grand theft, which turned out to be true, but to everyone's surprise, it wasn't us who were robbed, but the pirates! This is a team that dug a treasure on treasure island and, apparently, having found it, decided to get away with the gold. What should I do with them?"
 flavor_ZLP.8.a: "The pirates will drink them anyway. Confiscate everything."
 flavor_ZLP.8.b: "Let's do it honorably. Hand over the traitors to the pirates."
 flavor_ZLP.9.t: "The pirates were found..."
 flavor_ZLP.9.d: "They were found hanging on the gallows. First we were robbed by our own comrades, and then by the Buddhists, damn them! We've been double-crossed!"
 flavor_ZLP.9.a: "They will pay!"
 flavor_ZLP.10.t: "A nice gift"
 flavor_ZLP.10.d: "When we were sitting in the camp on treasure Island, people in robes came up to us and invited us to an audience. Everything looked extremely suspicious, nerves were on edge and when it seemed that we were trapped, they brought out a group of some men in shackles... It's them, pirates that robbed us! And immediately after them they brought a chest full of gold! The Buddhist negotiator said that they had caught these little bastards on their land and decided that it would be fair to give them to us for trial. In return, the ambassador only asked to hand over the island to them, because there is nothing else interesting on it anyway."
 flavor_ZLP.10.a: "Hooray, hooray, hooray!"
 flavor_ZLP.11.t: "Clouds are gathering"
 flavor_ZLP.11.d: "Recently, a rumor flashed through the city that someone had found a treasure on treasure island... the one I sold... As I was walking down the street, I heard someone say, 'We could have bought a beer today if that jerk hadn't sold the island for pennies.' They think I betrayed them, but how was I supposed to know? It seems that the situation is getting worse, they look at me askance, my authority is not respected... they're up to something..."
 flavor_ZLP.11.a: "Is that a pistol? Oh f..."
 flavor_ZLP.11.b: "I'll show them how not to respect me... HANG THEM ALL!"
